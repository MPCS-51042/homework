    "The Fictional Bureau of Public Health tests the water in various locations around MagicLand for a toxic substance called Mercuronium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mercuronium starts to cause symptoms, like lightheadedness, at around 495 parts per million. At a higher concentration (like 500 parts per million), the symptoms progress to headaches. At 505 parts per million, the symptoms become more severe and possibly permanent. So the government recommends that all water sources be kept under 490 parts per million of Mercuronium and sends toxicologists out to various locations to test the water. It is known that the tests are not perfect, so to avoid uncertainty, the toxicologists are sent on a pretty regular basis to take multiple measurements. \n",

You can do this by adjusting the proportions of the figure to spread out the names, by rotating the names (as I have done in the example), or by orienting your plot so that the locations are on the Y axis. You _should not_ do this by making the font on the labels smaller: that makes the chart inaccessible because people can't always read tiny fonts.\n",
