1. Based on your results running that test, do you think python evaluates expressions in normal order (lazy) or applicative order (eager)? Why?

2. Find a way to change the test method so that it only runs p() if the first argument x is not equal to zero. What did you change?

3. Can you think of a situation where you might want to define a method but make sure that that method is only called if and when its result is absolutely needed? In other words, describe a situation where you might want lazy evaluation.
