# How to use this homework repo

1. Go into the chapter that matches the chapter you are doing homework problems from in the [materials repo](https://github.com/MPCS-51042/materials).
2. There you will find a file for each of your homework problems, as well as any other materials you will need (like `.csv`s or text files).
3. Do your homework by modifying the methods in these files.
4. At the bottom of each `.py` file is a test that you can use to make sure your solution is working. To run the tests for problem 1 in chapter 2, for example, `cd` into the `homework` repo on your command line and run `python ch2/problem_1.py`.
