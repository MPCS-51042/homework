## Evaluating the `test` method:

**1. What differences do you notice between the functions that we do test with this method and the ones that we don't test with this method? Why do you think we chose to use it where we did?**


**2. If you were in charge of writing a Python package to help other programmers write automated tests in Python, what would you want it to do that the test method doesn't do? You can talk about functionalities that you wish it had that it doesn't have such as "I wish I could test stuff about a function besides just its return value", or you can talk about stuff that you wish it did differently such as "I wish the way the variables get passed in were more clear. Something like this...(and then explain how you'd like to see it done)."**
